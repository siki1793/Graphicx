Follow the steps :


1. Open the command prompt (Terminal in Linux).
2. Go to the folder where this text file is located.
3. Run the command "make" without "".
4. The command, if successfully executed, will generate a file named "output".
5. Run that output file by typing "./output", again without "".
6. You will see the Graphics Window with X,Y,Z axes drawn on it.
(NOTE : Z-axis is not visible to you.)
7. Press keys :
	"1" for Cube
	"2" for Cylinder.
	"3" for Sphere.
	"4" for Bunny.
8. The chosen object will be rendered on the screen.
9. Now, pick 2 points on screen using left mouse button.
10. You will see the line is drawn on these 2 points.
11. Now, to translate the object, distance measured in the 2 points is used as a relative measure.For translation, use keys:
	"UP" to translate in +ve Y-axis.
	"DOWN" to translate in -ve Y-axis.
	"LEFT" to translate in -ve X-axis.
	"RIGHT" to translate in +ve X-axis.
12. For zooming in/out, +/- keys have been used respectively.
(Note : Scale factor of 1.2 is used for zooming in/out.)
13. For Rotating the object, press the key "x"/"y"/"z".
(Note : Object rotates about the given axis by 15 degree each time the key is pressed. Quaternions are used.)
14. To move the light source press key "m".
(Note : Light rotates around X-axis).
15. Displaying bunny : 
	Press "v" : Per Vertex
	Press "p" : Per Polygon
16. Press "l" to move light source along with object.
13. Use right click mouse button to clear the screen and pick the object again.


Limitation:

1. The scale factor is restricted to 0.1 to 12.0.
2. Translation is restricted, choosing 2 points with long distance puts the object out of the window.
