Follow the steps :

1. Open terminal( Alt+Ctrl+T on linux ).
2. Go to the folder where this text file is located.
3. Run the command "make" without "".
4. Now in terminal type ./output to run the output file.
5. You will see the Graphics Window with X,Y,Z axes drawn on it.
(NOTE : Z-axis is not visible to you.)
6. The object will be rendered on the screen.(Light is fixed at (0.75,0.75,0) on the screen)
7. Now, drag mouse on screen using left mouse button.
	Rotate according to mouse movement.(TrackBall Rotation)
8. For rotation along individually axis,use keys:
		"x"  Rotate along -X-axis.
		"X"  Rotate along X-axis.	
		"y"  Rotate along -Y-axis.
		"Y"  Rotate along Y-axis.	
		"z"  Rotate along -Z-axis.
		"Z"  Rotate along Z-axis.	
9. To translate the object,use keys:
	"UP" to translate in +ve Y-axis.
	"DOWN" to translate in -ve Y-axis.
	"LEFT" to translate in -ve X-axis.
	"RIGHT" to translate in +ve X-axis.
10. For zooming/scaling,use keys:
		"-"  Scale -.(Zoom in)
		"+"  Scale +.(Zoom out)
		"c"  Camera movement along -Z-axis.
		"C"  Camera movement along Z-axis.
11.output of images are present in image directory
