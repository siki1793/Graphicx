Steps for output:

1.Open terminal.
2.Go to the folder where this text file is located.
3.Run the command "make" without "".
4.Now in terminal type ./output to run the output file.
5.You can see the x,y axes on screen.
6.You can draw the curves(Lagrange interpolating polynomial and BÃ©zier curve) by "left mouse click buttom".
7.You can Generate the curves,Delete points,Insert points,Rotate, Transulate, Scale, Transulate by picking two points and delete points by following keys and Draw the control polygon.
	press keys:
		"1"  Generate curves.
		"2"  Remove curves.
		"e"  Delete point.(Use RIGHT CLICK TO SELECT POINT)
		"q"  Insert point.
		"l"  Rotate left.
		"r"  Rotate right.
		"-"  Scale -.(Zoom in)
		"+"  Scale +.(Zoom out)
		"a"  Translate left.
		"w"  Translate up.
		"d"  Translate right.
		"s"  Translate down.
		"i"  Insert 2 points to translate with difference of points.(Use RIGHT CLICK TO SELECT POINT)
		"t"  Translate the curve with the picked points.
		"D"  Draw control polygon.
8.output of images are present in image directory


Limitation:

1. if points are picked after rotation , translate , scale and when you resize the window will be not accurate .
