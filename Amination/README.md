2. Go to the folder where this text file is located.
3. Run the command "./run.sh" without "".
4. Now in Scene window will be displayed to run the output file.
	(here texture folder has different textures and ply_files has different ply files).
5.scene graph has s1 s2 s3 nodes and the animation is done in idle function, a bounding box is present on model 1.
6.lighing is enabled on to objects by camera movement the following keys for lighting.
	"1" to enable normal lighting.
	"2"	for lighting via camera.
	"3"	spotlight on moving ply file 1.
	"4"	spotlight on moving ply file 2.
	"c" change the camera modes from model 1 ,model 2 and normal viewing
	"p" increase speed of model3.
	"o" decrease speed of model3.
	"l" increase speed of model1.
	"k" decrease speed of model1.
	"m" increase speed of model2.
	"n" decrease speed of model2.
	"UP" move the objects up.
	"DOWN" move the objects down.
	"LEFT" move the objects left.
